binary search alogrithm for flux fitting by varying M_UNIT

Written by J. Vos and J. Davelaar

===========================================================
USAGE
===========================================================

sbatch MUNITfinder.sh START STOP CADENCE INCLINATION

START = first grmhd slice index
STOP  = last grmhd slice index
CADENCE = cadence between slices
INCLINATION = viewing angle of observer


===========================================================
OPTIONS
===========================================================
in MUNITfinder.sh

NODES sets the amount of nodes to split the work on

in binsearch.py

F_desire = the amount of flux to aim for.

===========================================================
folders needed
===========================================================

output and slurm

output contains the spectra and images

slurm contains the slurm files of the runs used by the binary search alogorithm to compute M_UNIT, this is to keep the folder clean since they are with many.
